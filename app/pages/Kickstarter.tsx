        This Kickstarter is to raise money to build the first production run of
        Chromatron hardware. The majority of the timeline will be used for
        coordinating hardware production, building hardware test systems,
        creating documentation and tutorial content, and of course bug fixes for
        any issues that crop up.
      </p>

        The project itself has been under heavy development since August 2016,
        and most major technical aspects are very usable. The hardware itself
        has undergone five revisions, and over a dozen hand built examples are
        running 24/7.
